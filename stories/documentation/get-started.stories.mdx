# Get started

The core of `react-language-switcher` library leverages the [React Context API][1] by providing the set of two main components:

- a language Provider that provides the language context and the ways of using it
- a language Switcher component that allows you to style and use this logic

### Basic usage

Wrapping your application with a language Provider component exposes the language context to its children. Using a language
Switcher component anywhere inside the child component tree will consume the language context and provide you with an unstyled
unordered list of provided languages. Rendered list items contain unstyled buttons for changing the application language.

```tsx
import {
  LanguageProvider,
  LanguageSwitcher,
} from '@prototyp/react-language-switcher';

const App = () => (
  <LanguageProvider>
    <LanguageSwitcher />
  </LanguageProvider>
);
```

By default, the `LanguageProvider` component will use English as a selected language and the `LanguageSwitcher` component will render
a list with only the English language option.

Optionally, the `LanguageProvider` component takes a config object as a prop, which defines the selected language for the app
and a list of all languages that will be used inside the app.

```tsx
<LanguageProvider config={{ language: 'en', languageList: ['en', 'de', 'fr'] }}>
  <LanguageSwitcher />
</LanguageProvider>
```
